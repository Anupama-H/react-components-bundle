## Introduction to the RCB (React Components Bundle) library

RCB contains a bunch of low level components (atoms of a design system) that you can use individually 
or combine them to make additional components (molecules of a design system) to build web pages.

## Using the components library

First, install the package from npm

```
npm install react-components-bundle
```

Next, import the required components. There are 2 ways to achieve this.

If you want a minimal footprint from the RCB library and include only the components which you use, 
then import the components individually as shown below. 
This enables tree shaking and therefore components that you did not use will not get included in your final bundle.

```
import Button from "react-components-bundle/components/Button";
```

If size of the bundle does not matter or you will use all/most of the components in the RCB library, 
then you can import the components as shown below:

```
import { Button } from "react-components-bundle";
```

### Using core CSS

Finally, include the core CSS like below,

```
import "react-components-bundle/components/core.css";
```

The core CSS file will contain the core styles without which the component will not behave as expected. 
Hence do not forget to include this. 

### Using theme CSS

Theme CSS file will contain the styles which suggests a theme for all the components but is not a must have to use the library.

You can use the theme CSS in 2 ways:

**1. Use individual component CSS**

You can import the individual files for each of the components like below:

```
import "react-components-bundle/components/Table/tableTheme.css";
```

**2. Include the bundled CSS file which has all component's CSS**

You can import the bundled CSS file which contains all the component's CSS like below:

```
import "react-components-bundle/components/theme.css";
```
