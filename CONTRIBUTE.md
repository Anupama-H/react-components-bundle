## Setting up the project for development

### Prerequisites

Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Setting Up

Install the npm packages using the following command

```
npm install
```

Start the JS build with watcher using the following command

```
npm run build -- --watch
```

To watch SCSS files & compile them to CSS use the following command

```
npm run scss -- --watch
```

**Note:** Prefix all the CSS classNames with namespace `"RCB-"`

### Linting your JS files

Run the following command to lint the JS code

```
npm run lint
```

Or Install your editor specific plugin by referring to [this link](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations)

### Viewing the components

View the available components along with their accepted props using [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

To start the storybook run the following command

```
npm run storybook
```

The storybook can then be viewed at http://localhost:6006/

### Publishing the storybook to github pages

Run the following command to publish the storybook to github pages:

```
npm run deploy-storybook
```

### Creating new stories for the components

To help boostrap a new story file, use the following steps

1. Install the VS Code extension [File Templates](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brpaz.file-templates)
2. Place the templates in the location expected by the extension
    - In Mac,
    ```cp ./vscode-templates/NewStoryTemplate.stories.js $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/FileTemplates```

    - In Linux,
    ```cp ./vscode-templates/NewStoryTemplate.stories.js $HOME/.config/Code/User/FileTemplates```

    - In Windows,
    ```cp ./vscode-templates/NewStoryTemplate.stories.js C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\FileTemplates```
3. To use the templates you can do one of the following:
    - In VSCode, right click on the folder where you want to generate the new file. You should see an option "Files : New from template". Selecting this option a list of available templates should appear. Just select your template and the file will be created.
    - You can also do the same from the Command Palette. In this case the new file will be created in the root directory of the project.
    - Its also possible to do the other way around and create a template based on an open file. For that "right-click" on any opened file and you should see the option of the context menu.

**Note:** The template will expect the Component name as a parameter

## TODO
